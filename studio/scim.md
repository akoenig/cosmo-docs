# SCIM

Consolidating workforce management into a single platform proves more efficient than handling it separately for each product utilized. SCIM aims to synchronize identity data seamlessly between the company's identity provider and its array of employed products.

SCIM provides the following:-

1. Create users
   * When a user is added to the SCIM app, it creates the user on Cosmo and then adds them to their respective organization.
2. Update user attributes
   * When the user's attributes (who is a member of the scim app) are modified, it syncs it with Cosmo.
3. Deactivate users
   * When a user is removed from the SCIM app, it deactivates the respective user's account on Cosmo.
