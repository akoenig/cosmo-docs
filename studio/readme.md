# Readme

The README serves as the central space for detailing the federated graph or subgraph. It allows for sharing how the graph functions with all team members and may include details about maintainers for easy contact regarding any needs or queries.



The README can be added to your federated or subgraph while creating them using the `--readme` option.

In case the README is not added during the creation of the graph, you can update the federated graph or the subgraph with the readme using the `--readme` option with the update command of the [federated graph](../cli/federated-graph/update.md) or [subgraph](../cli/subgraph/update.md) respectively.
