Cosmo is fully open-source and will always remain so. Its extensive range of features makes it one of the most advanced and cost-efficient GraphQL Platforms for both small and large companies.

While you have the option to operate the open-source solution independently, we strongly advise considering support. This recommendation comes from a place of caution and care: managing a platform at this complexity without the necessary expertise could pose risks to your business. We're here to assist, ensuring you make the most of this solution safely and effectively.

At Wundergraph, we have an in-depth understanding of how the software works and how to operate every single component. For your information, we manage [Cosmo Cloud](https://wundergraph.com/pricing) to provide a fully managed solution. We're aware that some companies face stringent regulations and cannot deploy it in other environments. For that reason, we offer specialized support.

As part of our enterprise contract, we offer a direct support channel (Slack, Teams) with our engineers that empowers your team to maximize the benefits of Cosmo. We provide assistance with development, ongoing maintenance, migrations, and support for long-term release versions.&#x20;
