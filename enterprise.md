Cosmo is fully open-source and will always remain so. Its extensive range of features makes it one of the most advanced and cost-efficient GraphQL Platforms for both small and large companies.

At Wundergraph, we have an in-depth understanding of how the software works and how to operate every single component. For your information, we manage [Cosmo Cloud](https://wundergraph.com/pricing) to provide a fully managed solution. We're aware that some companies face stringent regulations and cannot deploy it in other environments.

While you have the option to operate the open-source solution independently, we do not recommend doing without support. The reason is straightforward and rooted in our commitment to continuous improvement: we are best able to enhance and develop our services when we can directly observe how they are used. This approach allows us to concentrate our efforts on providing the highest quality of service to our valued paying customers.

As part of our enterprise contract, we offer a direct support channel (Slack, Teams) with our engineers that empowers your team to maximize the benefits of Cosmo. We provide assistance with development, ongoing maintenance, migrations, and support for long-term release versions.&#x20;
