# Cosmo Cloud

If you don't want to manage the platform yourself, you can use our managed service [WunderGraph Cosmo Cloud](https://cosmo.wundergraph.com). It is a fully managed platform that doesn't make you worry about infrastructure, so you can focus on building. The managed service has a trial period. If you want continued access, please contact us [here](https://form.typeform.com/to/oC6XATf4).
